Often times we need a way to simulate local domain name pointing to your `api` or `web` development running in your localhost and it is critical if you use kubernetes ingress controller i.e. `nginx` `traefik` controllers to test your configuration in the local Mac laptop.

This blog post will play as foundation for my upcoming kubernetes articles. Follow the below steps to setup your local Domain Name Service.

1. create a new ip e.g. `10.0.0.1`
```
sudo ifconfig lo0 10.0.0.1 alias
```

2. Forward the new ip address with port 80 `10.0.0.1:80` to your local `api` or `web` running in different ports, in this example my api is running in port `:3000`

```
echo "rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to 10.0.0.1 port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 3000" | sudo pfctl -ef -
```

3. Edit your `/etc/hosts` or `/private/etc/hosts` file and add the following line to map your domain, in my case I use fake domain name as `zypress.me` to `10.0.0.1`

```
10.0.0.1 zypress.me
```

4. After you saving your hosts file, flush your local DNS to clear the DNS cache.

```
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

5. Access your `api` or `web` application using the just created fake dns `http://zypress.me`

##  How to Delete the just created ip?

```
sudo ifconfig lo0 10.0.0.1 -alias
```
