Zypress is a Vue.js based Jamstack framework weaved out of NuxtJS + Tailwindcss to rapidly build modern websites any thing you can imagine. It comes preloaded with a personal website stater-kit to power blog and documenation websites.

In the year, 2019, I got introduced to Vue.JS then to tailwindcss and Nuxt.js and immediately fell in love with the Nuxt.JS (Vue.js) Power, Flexiblity and Easy to learn nature of the framework. Adding Tailwindcss (tailwind.UI) to Nuxt elevated the overall design, development and user experience and I decided to start building a generic high level web development framework with the following design goals and the result is zypress (inspired by the name Vuepress) which I open-sourced to the community today, 4th July 2021 and committed to work on this personal project.



## Zypress Need and Design Goals

* Should power my personal blog [www.senthilsweb.com] (https://blog.senthilsweb.com)
* Web application and documentation (like Gitbook) in a single codebase 
* Modern framework fit for cloud first model
* Static & dynamic website development
* Full SEO Support
* Easy to build, deploy and maintain 
* No or Low cost maintenance
* Minimalistic design
* UX standardization
* Mobile optimized
