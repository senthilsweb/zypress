This post will guide you to expose your local development websites and webhooks or any http applications running in your home servers to public internet in a safe and secure manner using free Cloudflare (cloudflared) tunnel client also known as Argo Tunnel. It is 100% free and doesn't requre any registrations or Credit card details.

## Use cases

Common usecases where tunneling softwares will be handy

<list :items="usecases"></list>

## Architecture

`cloudflared` is command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins. This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver) as shown in the network architecture diagram.

## Getting Started

[Download](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#macos) cloudfalred tunnel client

## Installation

cd into the folder where your downloaded cloudflared

<code-group>
<code-block label="Bash" active>

  ```bash
  cd [path where your downloaded cloudflared]/
  ```
</code-block>
</code-group>


Run the tunnel pointing to your local website url. In my case, I am running grafana in a docker container at port 3000

<code-group>
<code-block label="Bash" active>

  ```bash
  ./cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
  ```
</code-block>
</code-group>

## Cloudflared Features

## Cloudflared shortcomings

The cloudflared tunneling client doesn't support non http protocols (i.e. `tcp`). E.g. expose MS SQL Server or PostgreSQL dabases running your local. 

## Alternate softwares

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) supports both http and tcp however the free version supports just one instance of `ngrok`. 

Expose MS SQL server running in your local machine at port #. 1433

<code-group>
<code-block label="Bash" active>

  ```bash
  ./ngrok tcp 1433
  ```
</code-block>
</code-group>
