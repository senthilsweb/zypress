Unlike wordpress or other blog / websites, this one is all yours. Publish your work on a custom domain and host it in popular serverless JAMSTACK sites like netlify, surge.sh, heroku etc. 

<!--more-->

Zypress is an open source app which means you can customize absolutely everything without having any andvanced programming skills or web design skills. Just by editing the simple config files listed below at the root of the project, you'll find straightforward controls for changing colors, navigation, logos and settings â€” so you can set your site up just how you like it.

* root/content/settings.json
* root/nuxt.config.js 
* root/tailwind.config.js 
  

 If you're feeling a little more adventurous and if you have knowledge on Frontend development using node.js, any JAMSTACK frameworks then there's really no limit to what's possible. Zypress is built using Vue.js, Nuxt.js and Tailwid.css., learning and developing using these technologies are real fun and easy. Advanced developers can go even further and build a fullstack dynamic website by connecting to your REST or GraphQL APIs.

For now, you're probably just wondering what to do first. To help get you going as quickly as possible, I've populated the site with starter content (like this post!) and a Getting started developer userguide.
