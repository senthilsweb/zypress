## Challenges Faced

One of the application monitoring process where I was engaged in the past involved various web console monitoring, **SOAP web services** monitoring, Querying multiple **Oracle** databases for informations, **Email processing** sent to a particular account and **nGINX logs** monitoring using **nGINX+** dashboard. 

All of these needs to be monitored every **30 minutes** and then notifying various Infrastructure groups using different notification and alerting mechanism i.e. Skype, Whatsapp and Email as instructed for taking necessary actions to maintain Business continuity and Business as-usual.  

The time taken to complete the monitoring and notification for single iteration requires approximately **1 hour**. The person in-charge in the shift will be continuously monitoring on an average **7 hours** in his **8 hours** shift and he / she will feel monotonous and leads to attrition otherwise more human power require to distribute the tasks which will only work in shared service model.

## Solution: Human assisted bots for the repetable task
